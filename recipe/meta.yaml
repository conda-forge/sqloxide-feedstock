  summary: Python bindings for sqlparser-rs
  description: |
    The original goal of this project was to have a very fast, efficient, and accurate 
    SQL parser I could use for building data lineage graphs across large code bases 
    (think hundreds of auto-generated .sql files). Most existing sql parsing approaches 
    for python are either very slow or not accurate (especially in regards to deeply 
    nested queries, sub-selects and/or table aliases). Looking to the rust community 
    for support, I found the excellent sqlparser-rs crate which is quite easy to wrap 
    in python code.
